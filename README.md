# quiz_answer_logger
Program that logs your answer from A, B, C, or D


Homework from a SCRIMBA lesson with an increment counter. 
The homework was to make it my own and upload it to Netlify, and I'm pleased that I was not only able to personalize the program but to modify it from 
a one-button increment counter to a 4-button Answer Logger, logging the user's choice of A, B, C, or D onto the results below. 
Thanks for readin :)
